ðŸ§  Problem: Area Distortion by Linear Transformation
Youâ€™re given a 2D triangle in space with vertices:
A=(0,0)A = (0, 0)A=(0,0)


B=(1,0)B = (1, 0)B=(1,0)


C=(0,1)C = (0, 1)C=(0,1)


This forms a right triangle with area = 0.5.
You are then given a linear transformation matrix TTT that you must apply to all three points of the triangle:
T=[2113]T = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}T=[21â€‹13â€‹]
Your task:
Apply the transformation TTT to all three vertices.


Compute the area of the new triangle formed by the transformed points.


Compare the new area with the original. Does the result match the determinant of TTT?


Plot both triangles (before and after transformation) for visual comparison.



âœ… Bonus:
Can you generalize the area scaling for any triangle under a 2D transformation?
