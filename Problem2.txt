📘 PRACTICE PROBLEM: Four Fundamental Subspaces (CS Student Edition)

You are given a data matrix A ∈ ℝ⁴ˣ⁵, where each row is a data point and each column is a feature.

Let:
A = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
]

🔧 Tasks:

1. Column Space (C(A))
   - Find a basis for the column space of A.
   - What is the dimension of the column space?
   - What does this tell you about the effective number of features?

2. Null Space (N(A))
   - Find a basis for the null space of A, i.e., solve A·x = 0.
   - Interpret this in terms of feature redundancy.

3. Row Space (C(Aᵀ))
   - Find a basis for the row space of A.
   - What is the rank of A? Does it match the rank from the column space?

4. Left Null Space (N(Aᵀ))
   - Find a basis for the left null space of A.
   - Interpret this in terms of data redundancy.

💡 Interpretation:
- How many linearly independent features are there?
- How many linearly independent data points are there?
- If you were to compress this dataset using PCA, what would be the minimal number of components needed?

🧪 Bonus:
Write a Python function using NumPy or SymPy to compute:
- Basis for null space and left null space
- Rank of the matrix
- Column and row spaces
